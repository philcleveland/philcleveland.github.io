Today I launched my blog.  I used Jekyll and Github pages and it was pretty easy.  Here are a few links that were really helpful in getting started.

I really recommend starting with this article. It's nothing fancy, but it will get you up and running quickly.  

[Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages by Barry Clark](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/){:target="_blank"}

One thing to note that is not addressed in the article.  Before you commit to your own GitHub repository you should blow away the forked commits.
I just did a ```rm -fdr .git``` from the base directory and then ```git init``` and reset my remote repository.

Here is a very helpful markdown cheatsheet that will help with any pages you do in markdown(.md) files.

Since there isn't a favicon.ico by default, [Favicon Generator](http://paulferrett.com/fontawesome-favicon/){:target="_blank"} is a great place to get one.  It allows you to download any icon from the [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) set.
