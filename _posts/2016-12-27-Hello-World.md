Hi, I'm Phil.

I hope this site can provide some value to you. It is going to be dedicated to software development.  I really like learning new technologies, so there is a good chance that this site will have a smattering of lots of tech that I am interested
in.  Right now that is probably going to tend towards F#, Elixir, Go and C# using .NET Core.
