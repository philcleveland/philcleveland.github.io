Hi, I'm Phil.
I like a lot of things (skiing, zymurgy, technolgy), but this site is going to be 
dedicated to software development.  I really like learning new technologies, so there
is a good chance that this site will have a smattering of lots of tech that I am interested
in.  Right now that is probably going to tend towards F#, Elixir, Go and C# using
.NET Core.

If you want to look at some of my code check out [Phil Cleveland](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub
