![Avatar]({{ site.avatar }}){:class="site-avatar"}

Hi, I'm Phil.

  I like a lot of things. I am addicted to skiing, I love brewing beer, wine, and ciders. And I really love learning new technologies. At the moment I am interested
in F#, Elixir, Go and C# using .NET Core. 

I have worked with other technologies like WPF, Javascript, Visual Basic, and ASP.NET as well.  I have also studied up on stuff like [Domain Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design){:target="_blank"} and 
[CQRS](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html){:target="_blank"}.  I think it would be very interesting and fun to use [Event Storming](http://ziobrando.blogspot.com/2013/11/introducing-event-storming.html){:target="_blank"}
to design a business domain.

### More Information

I am available for work.  Check out my [resume]({{ site.baseurl }}/resume) and [contact me](mailto:phil.cleveland@gmail.com).

#### More More Information

What the heck is with the name of the blog? [Off-Piste](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/off-piste){:target="_blank"}.  

TLDR; It's a skiing term meaning off the groomed runs.
